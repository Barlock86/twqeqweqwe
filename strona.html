        S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
        Let's hear it
        S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
        Let's hear it
        Let's go!
        
        I’ve had enough
        There’s a voice in my head
        Says I'm better off dead
        
        But if I sing along a little fucking louder
        To a happy song I’ll be alright
        
        You want to give up
        Gave it all that you've got
        And it still doesn’t cut
        
        But if you sing along a little fucking louder
        To a happy song
        You’ll be just fine cause
        
        Every now and again we get that feeling
        And the great big void inside us opens up
        And I really wish that you could help
        But my head is like a carousel
        And I’m going round in circles, going round in circles
        
        S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
        Let's hear it
        S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
        Let's hear it
        
        We are possessed
        We’re all fucked in the head
        Alone and depressed
        
        But if we sing along a little fucking louder
        To a happy song
        Maybe we’ll forget cause
        
        Every now and again we get that feeling
        And the great big void inside us opens up
        And I really wish that you could help
        But my head is like a carousel
        And I'm going round in circles, going round in circles
        
        Don't wake us up
        We’d rather just keep dreaming
        Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
        And I really wish that you could help
        But my head is like a carousel
        And I’m going round in circles, going round in circles
        
        The world has coalesced
        Into one giant mess of hate and unrest
        So lets all sing along a little god damn louder
        To a happy song and pretend it’s all ok
        
        Let's go!
        
        So let's sing along
        Let's sing along
        A little fucking louder!
        A little fucking louder!
        Well don't you feel so much better!
        
        S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
        Let's hear it
        (Well that's the spirit)
        S-P-I-R-I-T, spirit
        Let's hear it
        (Yeah, that's the spirit)
